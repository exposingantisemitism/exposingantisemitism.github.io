<title>Hello World!</title>
<p>Explaining the antisemitic lies:</p>

 <p>Let me first start off with the controversial practice of Metzitzah b'peh or oral suction as it's called in English,
   this is a practice where mohel places his mouth on a new born's circumcised penis and sucks the blood, pretty disgusting right? But what if I were to tell you that it's not widely practiced anymore, the largest group of Orthodox rabbis (Rabbinical Council of America) has called for the abandonment of the practice. It's only practiced by crazy ultra-orthodox Haerdi Jews.</p>

 <p>Talmudic lies: There's images going around saying that the Talmud promotes such Jewish supremacist ideals and that we Jews want to slaughter everyone, well we don't and most of those verses are a lie.</p>

 <p>1. Yebamoth 98a: There's no such thing as Yebamoth, but let's give it the benefit of the doubt and say that they were talking about Yevamot 98a, 
   well there's no such verse that states that all gentile children are animals, don't believe me? Look it up yourself: https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.98a.1?lang=bi</p>

 <p>2. Sanhedrin 57a: It states in a very miscontextualized verse "When a Jew murders a non-Jew, they shall face no death penalty". 
   Well, It's absolutely not saying that killing a gentile is permitted. The Jewish court — the Sanhedrin — doesn't have jurisdiction over cases where the victim isn't Jewish. 
   They didn't have any power over "outsiders" because the Sanhedrin only deals with Jews and Jewish matter. So it wasn't for the Sanhedrin to have the power in a case involving gentiles.
   But it was still definitely forbidden to kill them. Does that make sense Goyim?</p>

 <p>3. Kethuboth 11b: The actual name of this chapter is Ketubot, and the poster that goes around states that it says "A man who engages in intercourse with a girl less than three years of age has done nothing." 
   Which it does NOT say that at all, not even out of context that is just straight up lying, the full verse states "And similarly, with regard to a female convert, or a captive woman, or a maidservant, who were ransomed with regard to the captive, 
   or who converted with regard to the convert, or who were freed with regard to the maidservant, when she was more than three years and one day old, for all of these, their marriage contract is one hundred dinars and they are not subject to a claim concerning their virginity. 
   When they married, their presumptive status was that of a non-virgin." If you Goyim use your eyes you can see it's talking about female captives who were captured by bad guys and forced into marriage and raped, this basically states that if they want to continue the marriage it will be 100 dinars and they will have to be considered non-virgins in the marriage with no punishment, 
   again, it's the person who got raped who gets no punishment.</p>

 <p>4. Shabbath 116a: The chapter that is Shabbat supposedly states in 116a "Jews must destroy the books of the Christians",
   it doesn't say that, the only mentioning of destroying is the books of the heretics, not Christians personally, 
   only if they (the heretics) cause division and chaos among the Jewish people. It states that specifically in verse 9 of 116a: 
   "My name that was written in sanctity shall be erased in the water in the framework of the ordeal of the sota; these, the heretics, who impose jealousy, and hatred, 
   and conflict between the Jewish people and their Father in Heaven, 
   all the more so it is proper to erase God's names because of them." So it's basically saying if you leave us alone we'll leave you alone. 
   Check it out yourself: https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.116a.9?lang=bi</p>

 <p>5. Baba Mezia 114b: The actual chapter being Bava Metzia, the supposed verse states that "non-Jews are not human, they are beasts", 
   which again, is a fake verse, they are referencing the true verse of 114b verse 2 which actually states the opposite, and says that Jews being taught that gentiles aren't human (They never even say the word "beast) is wrong. 
   It states "Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says that the graves of gentiles do not render one impure, as it is stated: “And you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, are man” (Ezekiel 34:31),
   which teaches that you, i.e., the Jewish people, are called “man,” but gentiles are not called “man.” Since the Torah states with regard to ritual impurity imparted in a tent: “If a man dies in a tent” (Numbers 19:14),
   evidently impurity imparted by a tent does not apply to gentiles." I love how Goyim ignore the last statement that this all doesn't apply to gentiles.</p>

 <p>6. Zohar Toldoth Noah 63b: Doesn't exist, it's not real, look it up on https://Sefaria.org, all lies lmao</p>

 <p>7. Gitten 57a: In this chapter it supposedly says the Jesus is burning in his own semen, 
   though it doesn't, it talks about a person named Balaam, not Jesus, Balaam was a non-biblical prophet and the son of Beor, 
   doesn't sound like Jesus to me, 
   but in rabbinical culture he is regarded as bad.</p>
  
  <p>8. Baba Kamma 113a: Supposedly the verse in Bava Kamma 113a states "Jews may use lies to circumvent non-Jews",
    well sorry Goyim but it states right beside that verse: "Rabbi Akiva disagrees and says: One does not approach the case circuitously in order to vindicate the Jew due to the sanctification of God's name,
    as God's name will be desecrated if the Jewish judge employs dishonest means." And this talks about going to court for deceiving,
    and the Jew may be vindicated if it's okay under gentile law and Jewish law, same with the gentile, he may be vindicated if it's okay under gentile law and the gentile would be told " 
    if you can vindicate the Jew under Jewish law, vindicate him, and say to the gentile: This is our law. If he can be vindicated under gentile law, vindicate him, and say to the gentile: This is your law.
    And if it is not possible to vindicate him under either system of law, one approaches the case circuitously, seeking a justification to vindicate the Jew.",
    so you also must receive justification to vindicate the Jew and you can't do it out of spite.</p>
 
  <p>9. Sanhedrin 57a: Now I know you're probably saying that we went over this in number 1,
     but this is about a different verse, in this verse it supposedly says "what a Jew steals from a non-Jew he may keep",
     now in the actually verse the Gemara is actually ASKING if it's permissible,
     and when it's answered it's challenged by the Gemara stating
     "If the baraita were to state that if a gentile does so, he is liable,
     it would have to state that if a Jew does so to a gentile, he is exempt, because this is the opposite of liable.
     That would indicate that it is actually prohibited for a Jew to do so to a gentile, and that he is merely exempt from liability,
     which is not the case." That basically states that the Jew is not exempt from punishment of robbery.</p>

  <p>10. Sanhedrin 58b: It states in Sanhedrin 58b that if a gentile strikes a Jew then he is liable for the death penalty,
     but the context for it is different, this is an example statement for a metaphor and to not be taken as Halakah (Jewish Law).
     The verse it's quoting is an interpretation of what Moses saw an Egyptian do to an Israelite which was continued as a metaphor
     the metaphor being "One who strikes [nokesh] a Jew is considered as though he hurt the cheek [lo’a] of the Holy One.", the term: 
     "Holy One", comes from the sacred belief that Jews are the chosen people but not the embodiment of G-d.</p>

  <p>11. Jalkut Rubeni Gadol 12b: Not a real chapter, not a real verse, do basic research.</p>

  <p>12. Yalkut 245c: Not a real chapter or verse, the name "Yalkut" is stolen from the Yalkut Shimoni on the Torah,
     which is a midrash on the books of Tanakh.</p>

  <p>13. Zohar 1160a: Not a real chapter or verse, the name Zohar is completely stolen from the Kabbalah chapter Zohar,
     it doesn't even extend to 1160a as it only extends to 309b Volume III.</p>

  <p>14. Libbre David 37: Doesn't exist, it's completely made up and has no source in the Tanakh, Talmud, Kabbalah,
     or anything Halakhic at all.</p>

  <p>15. Rashi Ereget Erod 22 30: Completely made up, no source for it at all.</p>

  <p>16. Lebhammoth 61a: Though the chapter is completely made up, the verse it's referring to exists in Yevamot 61a,
     it states "Jewish people, are called men [adam] but gentiles are not called men [adam].",
     this is refuted by the Gemara in the next verse where it states "The Gemara raises an objection based upon the verse with regard to captives taken during the war against Midian: 
     “And the persons [nefesh adam] were sixteen thousand” (Numbers 31:40), which indicates that gentiles are also referred to as adam."
     and either way they're both talking about the graves in corpses, not all Jews and gentiles.</p>

  <p>17. Kerithuth 6b: The chapter it's referring to is Keritot and the verse says that "The Jews are human,
     not the goyim, they are animals" well firstly it's all referring to corpses and what is liable to recieve Kareth,
     AKA being expelled, but it's a corpse how are they going to expell a corpse? Well, it's talking about the souls of such,
     and it's not debating if gentiles are human it's debating whether or not if gentile corpses are exempt like how animals are
     when anointment oil is applied to their skin.</p>

  <p>18. Schene Luchoth Haberith 250b: Not Talmud, the actual name is Shenei Luchot HaBerit and is a writing by Rabbi Isaiah HaLevi Horovitz,
     and the Schene Luchoth Haberith is a part of a group of literature called "Musar", which is a library of philosophy and ethics from the
     19th century Musar movement in Lithuania.</p>

  <p>19. Tosaphot, Jebamoth 98b: Doesn't exist, can't even find anything about it except a few Twitter posts and some antisemitic wordpress websites.</p>

  <p>20. Choschen Hamm 183: Doesn't exist, fake verse made up in the antisemitic propaganda book called "The Talmud Unmasked".</p>

  <p>21. Lore Dea 157: Absolutely misspelled (It's almost like Goyim don't do research) the actual name being Yoreh Deah and in chapter 157 of it,
     it states nothing of lying or deceiving of anything. Completely made up verse by antisemites.</p>

  <p>22. Schabbouth Hag 6d: Doesn't exist, only popularized by a few Twitter users who can't do basic research.</p>

  <p>23. Avodah Zarah 4b: The chapter supposedly says "You (the Jews) may kill a goy with your hands",
     it doesn't say this, the chapter of 4b doesn't state the word kill, murder, or gentile a single time:
     https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.4b.1?lang=bi</p>

  <p>24. Bammidber Raba c 21 & Jalkut 772: Jalkut does not exist, and Bammidber Raba is a midrash of the Talmud and not the Talmud itself,
     and it supposedly says "Every Jew who sheds the blood of the Goyim is the same amount of an offering to G-d",
     it does not mention goyim or gentiles at all, it's modified to say that, the original text is "of the wicked", not gentiles,
     some might argue that the wicked are the gentiles but this can be proven wrong since the definition of "wicked"
     is someone who causes mischief and chaos, gentiles are just non-Jews.</p>

  <p>25. Sepher Or Israel 177b: Doesn't exist, do basic research</p>

  <p>26. Zohar [Volume II] 64b: It's supposedly says that the birth rate of the gentiles needs to be dminished,
     but what comfuses me is that Volume II 64b of the Zohar doesn't mention gentiles a single time,
     nor does it mention birth rates.</p>

  <p>27. Sefer HaIkkarim Title III c25: Firstly, this is more an opinionated exposition by Rabbi Joseph Albo
     and has nothing to do with the Talmud, and the piece it's referring to here is the killing of idolators,
     and this is a lot of times replaced by "goyim" in order to make this sound bad. This doesn't permit the killing of anyone,
     this is only a piece to review Jewisu philosophy and opinions of 14-15th century Rabbis.</p>

  <p>28. Chagigah 15b: This is supposedly saying that a Jew is good no matter what sins they may do,
     this is not what it says, it mentions nothing of sins or goodness.</p>

  <p>29. Lore Dea 147: Again, it's misspelled and it's supposed to be Yoreh Deah, and again, nothing mentioned of not being allowed to wish well to the Goyim.</p>
