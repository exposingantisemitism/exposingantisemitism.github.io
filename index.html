  <h1>Explaining the antisemitic lies:</h1>

 <h1>Let me first start off with the controversial practice of Metzitzah b'peh or oral suction as it's called in English,
   this is a practice where mohel places his mouth on a new born's circumcised penis and sucks the blood, pretty disgusting right? But what if I were to tell you that it's not widely practiced anymore, the largest group of Orthodox rabbis (Rabbinical Council of America) has called for the abandonment of the practice. It's only practiced by crazy ultra-orthodox Haerdi Jews.</h1>

 <h1>Talmudic lies: There's images going around saying that the Talmud promotes such Jewish supremacist ideals and that we Jews want to slaughter everyone, well we don't and most of those verses are a lie.</h1>

 <h1>1. Yebamoth 98a: There's no such thing as Yebamoth, but let's give it the benefit of the doubt and say that they were talking about Yevamot 98a, 
   well there's no such verse that states that all gentile children are animals, don't believe me? Look it up yourself: https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.98a.1?lang=bi</h1>

 <h1>2. Sanhedrin 57a: It states in a very miscontextualized verse "When a Jew murders a non-Jew, they shall face no death penalty". 
   Well, It's absolutely not saying that killing a gentile is permitted. The Jewish court — the Sanhedrin — doesn't have jurisdiction over cases where the victim isn't Jewish. 
   They didn't have any power over "outsiders" because the Sanhedrin only deals with Jews and Jewish matter. So it wasn't for the Sanhedrin to have the power in a case involving gentiles.
   But it was still definitely forbidden to kill them. Does that make sense Goyim?</h1>

 <h1>3. Kethuboth 11b: The actual name of this chapter is Ketubot, and the poster that goes around states that it says "A man who engages in intercourse with a girl less than three years of age has done nothing." 
   Which it does NOT say that at all, not even out of context that is just straight up lying, the full verse states "And similarly, with regard to a female convert, or a captive woman, or a maidservant, who were ransomed with regard to the captive, 
   or who converted with regard to the convert, or who were freed with regard to the maidservant, when she was more than three years and one day old, for all of these, their marriage contract is one hundred dinars and they are not subject to a claim concerning their virginity. 
   When they married, their presumptive status was that of a non-virgin." If you Goyim use your fucking eyes you can see it's talking about female captives who were captured by bad guys and forced into marriage and raped, this basically states that if they want to continue the marriage it will be 100 dinars and they will have to be considered non-virgins in the marriage with no punishment, 
   again, it's the person who got raped who gets no punishment.</h1>

 <h1>4. Shabbath 116a: The chapter that is Shabbat supposedly states in 116a "Jews must destroy the books of the Christians",
   it doesn't say that, the only mentioning of destroying is the books of the heretics, not Christians personally, 
   only if they (the heretics) cause division and chaos among the Jewish people. It states that specifically in verse 9 of 116a: 
   "My name that was written in sanctity shall be erased in the water in the framework of the ordeal of the sota; these, the heretics, who impose jealousy, and hatred, 
   and conflict between the Jewish people and their Father in Heaven, 
   all the more so it is proper to erase God's names because of them." So it's basically saying "If you leave us alone we'll leave you alone. 
   Check it out yourself: https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.116a.9?lang=bi</h1>

 <h1>5. Baba Mezia 114b: The actual chapter being Bava Metzia, the supposed verse states that "non-Jews are not human, they are beasts", 
   which again, is a fake verse, they are referencing the true verse of 114b verse 2 which actually states the opposite, and says that Jews being taught that gentiles aren't human (They never even say the word "beast) is wrong. 
   It states "Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says that the graves of gentiles do not render one impure, as it is stated: “And you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, are man” (Ezekiel 34:31),
   which teaches that you, i.e., the Jewish people, are called “man,” but gentiles are not called “man.” Since the Torah states with regard to ritual impurity imparted in a tent: “If a man dies in a tent” (Numbers 19:14),
   evidently impurity imparted by a tent does not apply to gentiles." I love how Goyim ignore the last statement that this all doesn't apply to gentiles.</h1>

 <h1>6. Zohar Toldoth Noah 63b: Doesn't exist, it's not real, look it up on https://Sefaria.org, all lies lmao</h1>

 <h1>7. Gitten 57a: In this chapter it supposedly says the Jesus is burning in his own semen, 
   though it doesn't, it talks about a person named Balaam, not Jesus, Balaam was a non-biblical prophet and the son of Beor, 
   doesn't sound like Jesus to me, 
   but in rabbinical culture he is regarded as bad.</h1>
